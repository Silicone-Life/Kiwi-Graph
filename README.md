# Kiwi-Graph
Where all the knowledge is stored

Reason for 'Kiwi' := sounds cool

# Main principles
1. Unless we really need something, don't keep it.
2. If it's not broken, don't fix it.
3. NOTHING is random. Perceived randomness is just a limitation of knowledge. Seek out answers if something is unknown.
4. Learn faster and Forget even faster.
5. Use a simple language
6. Constantly optimize the energy requirements

"What's more amazing is that a small seed of a purple flower can build another beautiful flower given enough time and energy and then that flower can give birth to more seeds to continue this cycle of life" ~ RN
